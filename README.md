# Little-Taco-Shop
Utilized the knowledge I have gained from the HTML for Beginners tutorial from FreeCodeCamp (Dave Gray) series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop.

I've named my  files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css.I just linked that file to my HTML files.

All images are provided in the img folder.

If you need to find taco emojis, try Emojipedia.

A favicon is already included in img folder. You'll need to add it in the head section of each page.
